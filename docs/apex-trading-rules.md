# Apex Trader Funding - Trading Rules Summary

## Overview

Apex Trader Funding is a premier trader funding company specializing in futures market evaluations. The company offers two main account types: **Evaluation (Challenge) Accounts** and **Performance Accounts (PA) / Funded Accounts**. This document provides a comprehensive comparison of all trading rules for both account types.

## Key Differences Between Account Types

**Evaluation Accounts** are designed to help traders demonstrate their profitability and trading consistency over a minimum of 7 trading days. These accounts have fewer restrictions and are focused on achieving profit targets while staying within drawdown limits.

**Performance Accounts (PA) / Funded Accounts** are for traders who have passed evaluation and are eligible for payouts. These accounts have stricter consistency rules and risk management requirements to ensure disciplined, sustainable trading.

## Detailed Rule Explanations

### Drawdown Management

**Evaluation Accounts:**
- The trailing drawdown follows the highest peak of unrealized balance in real time
- Drawdown amounts vary by account size (e.g., $1,500 for $25K, $2,500 for $50K, $3,000 for $100K)
- The drawdown stops trailing at the safety net level (initial balance + drawdown + $100)

**PA / Funded Accounts:**
- Trailing drawdown works the same way but stops moving once safety net is reached
- For Static Accounts: Drawdown remains fixed (e.g., $625 for $100K Static account)
- No daily maximum drawdown limit exists for either account type

### Trading Hours and Holiday Rules

**All Account Types:**
- Trading allowed 6 PM ET one day to 4:59 PM ET the next day
